  Proj is a U.S. Government work and is not eligible for U.S. copyright
  protection.  This is free software.
 .
  Here's what Jerry replied when I asked what the license was:
 .
   `The software was developed by the USGS and has no copyright
    nor license.  Do with it what you will.  :-)'
 .
 Maintenance of proj has been taken up by Frank Warmerdam <warmerda@home.com>
 under the following license:
 .
   All source, data files and other contents of the PROJ.4 package are
   available under the following terms.  Note that the PROJ 4.3 and earlier
   was "public domain" as is common with US government work, but apparently
   this is not a well defined legal term in many countries.  I am placing
   everything under the following MIT style license because I believe it is
   effectively the same as public domain, allowing anyone to use the code as
   they wish, including making proprietary derivatives.
 .
   Though I have put my own name as copyright holder, I don't mean to imply
   I did the work.  Essentially all work was done by Gerald Evenden.
